# Medical_Component_Analysis

Medical supplies are used in various departments of the hospital

Although there is a large amount of data on medical supplies
However, there was a problem of not being able to make good use of the data.

Therefore, it was necessary to check the usage status of each department.

We created a system that automatically compiles the data into a csv file.

The Jupyter source file (git_spd_system.ipynb) is used to make the system work.
